Place the provided UnsikaLogo.png file here so the app can serve it directly from /images/UnsikaLogo.png.

Steps:

1. Save the provided attachment (UnsikaLogo.png) into this folder:

   public/images/UnsikaLogo.png

2. For development, run the Vite dev server so the new image is picked up automatically:

   # PowerShell
   npm run dev

   Or for a production build:

   # PowerShell
   npm run build

3. In the app we updated `resources/js/pages/dashboard.tsx` to reference `/images/UnsikaLogo.png`.

If you'd like, I can also add the image file into the repository for you (if you provide the binary or base64), or I can run the build step here. What would you like me to do next?
